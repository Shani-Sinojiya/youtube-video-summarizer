# Chapter 2 â€“ System Planning

## 2.1 Project Development Approach

### 2.1.1 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model

For the YouTube Video Summarizer System, we have adopted the **Agile Development Model** with elements of the **Iterative and Incremental Model**. This hybrid approach was selected based on the following considerations:

#### Reasons for Choosing Agile Methodology:

1. **Flexibility**: The project requirements evolved as we gained deeper understanding of AI integration complexities
2. **User Feedback**: Early prototypes allowed for continuous user feedback and requirement refinement
3. **Technology Integration**: Complex AI and modern web technologies required iterative testing and validation
4. **Risk Management**: Incremental development helped identify and mitigate technical risks early
5. **Team Collaboration**: Enhanced communication between frontend, backend, and AI integration teams

#### SDLC Phases Implementation:

1. **Planning Phase** (Week 1-2):

   - Requirements gathering and analysis
   - Technology stack selection
   - System architecture design
   - Project timeline establishment

2. **Design Phase** (Week 3-4):

   - Database schema design
   - API specification development
   - UI/UX wireframe creation
   - Security architecture planning

3. **Implementation Phase** (Week 5-12):

   - Sprint 1: User authentication and basic video processing
   - Sprint 2: AI integration and summarization features
   - Sprint 3: Chat system and RAG implementation
   - Sprint 4: Frontend development and UI integration

4. **Testing Phase** (Week 13-14):

   - Unit testing for individual components
   - Integration testing for API endpoints
   - User acceptance testing
   - Performance and security testing

5. **Deployment Phase** (Week 15-16):
   - Production environment setup
   - System deployment and monitoring
   - Documentation completion
   - User training and support

**Key Dependencies**:

1. Database setup is prerequisite for all data-dependent modules
2. AI integration depends on video processing completion
3. Chat system requires both AI integration and vector storage
4. Frontend development can proceed parallel to backend after API specification
5. Testing phases require completion of corresponding development phases

**Risk Mitigation**:

- Buffer time allocated for AI integration challenges
- Parallel development streams to minimize dependencies
- Regular integration testing to identify issues early
- Contingency plans for third-party service limitations
