# Chapter 2 â€“ System Planning

## 2.1 Project Development Approach

### 2.1.1 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model

For the YouTube Video Summarizer System, we have adopted the **Agile Development Model** with elements of the **Iterative and Incremental Model**. This hybrid approach was selected based on comprehensive analysis of project requirements, timeline constraints, and technical complexities.

#### SDLC Model Selection Criteria:

**Primary Considerations:**

- Project complexity requiring AI integration and modern web technologies
- Tight timeline requiring rapid development and deployment (55 days)
- Need for continuous stakeholder feedback and requirement refinement
- Integration challenges with multiple third-party services (YouTube API, Google AI)
- Team expertise in modern development practices and frameworks

**Alternative Models Considered:**

- **Waterfall Model**: Rejected due to inflexibility and sequential constraints
- **Spiral Model**: Rejected due to time constraints for extensive risk analysis cycles
- **DevOps Model**: Considered but requires more mature CI/CD infrastructure
- **RAD (Rapid Application Development)**: Partially adopted for prototyping phases

#### Reasons for Choosing Agile Methodology:

1. **Adaptive Planning**: The project requirements evolved as we gained deeper understanding of AI integration complexities and user needs
2. **Continuous Feedback**: Early prototypes allowed for continuous user feedback and requirement refinement throughout development
3. **Technology Integration**: Complex AI and modern web technologies required iterative testing and validation to ensure compatibility
4. **Risk Management**: Incremental development helped identify and mitigate technical risks early in the development cycle
5. **Team Collaboration**: Enhanced communication between frontend, backend, and AI integration teams through daily standups and sprint reviews
6. **Quality Assurance**: Continuous testing and integration ensured high-quality deliverables at each sprint
7. **Time Management**: Short sprints (1-2 weeks) enabled effective progress tracking and deadline adherence

#### Agile Methodology Characteristics Applied:

**Sprint Structure:**

- Sprint Duration: 7-14 days depending on complexity
- Sprint Planning: Detailed task breakdown and estimation
- Daily Standups: Progress tracking and impediment resolution
- Sprint Reviews: Stakeholder feedback and demonstration
- Retrospectives: Process improvement and lesson learned

**Key Agile Practices Implemented:**

- **User Stories**: Requirements defined as user-centric stories with acceptance criteria
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and code integration
- **Test-Driven Development**: Unit tests written before implementation
- **Pair Programming**: Complex AI integration tasks performed collaboratively
- **Refactoring**: Continuous code improvement and optimization
