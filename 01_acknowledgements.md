# Acknowledgements

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all those who contributed to the successful completion of this Software Engineering Project Report on the **YouTube Video Summarizer System**.

First and foremost, we thank our project supervisor and faculty members for their invaluable guidance, continuous support, and expert advice throughout the development lifecycle of this project. Their insights and feedback were instrumental in shaping the system architecture and ensuring adherence to software engineering best practices.

We extend our appreciation to the open-source community for providing excellent libraries and frameworks that formed the foundation of our system, including:

- **FastAPI** for the robust backend API framework
- **Next.js** for the modern frontend React framework
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.0)** for advanced AI capabilities
- **LangChain** for the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation
- **MongoDB** for the scalable NoSQL database solution
- **ChromaDB** for efficient vector storage and retrieval

We are grateful to **Google** for providing access to the Gemini AI models and **YouTube** for their comprehensive API that enables video information extraction and transcript processing.

Special thanks to our peers and colleagues who provided valuable feedback during the testing phases and helped identify areas for improvement in the user experience and system functionality.

We also acknowledge the extensive documentation and tutorials available online that aided our understanding of modern web development practices, AI integration, and software engineering methodologies.

Finally, we thank our families and friends for their patience, encouragement, and unwavering support throughout the duration of this project.

This project represents our collective effort to create an innovative solution for multilingual video content summarization and intelligent chat interaction, demonstrating the practical application of software engineering principles in developing AI-powered applications.
